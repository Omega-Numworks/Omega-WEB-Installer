      <p>WebUSB is currently only supported by Chromium / Google Chrome.</p>
      <p>For Chrome to communicate with a USB device, it must have permission to access the device and the operating system must be able to load a generic driver that libusb can talk to.</p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>On Windows, that means that an appropriate WinUSB/libusb driver must first be installed. This can be done manually with programs such as <a href="https://zadig.akeo.ie/">Zadig</a>.</li>
          <li>On Linux, that means that the current user must have permission to access the device.</li>
          <li>On macOS and ChromeBooks, it should work directly.</li>
        </ul>
